# Larissa 

This project is a website for the architecture firm Larissa Paschoalotto. It was developed in Next.JS and the objectives were to create an online presentation platform for the firm and provide a secure file repository to facilitate the communication and exchange of documents (contracts, photocopies, documents) between the architects and their clients. The platform has been integrated with AWS's S3 service for the repository and is expected to go live in early 2022.
